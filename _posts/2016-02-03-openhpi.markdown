openHPI is the MOOC platform of the Hasso Plattner Institute. As part of the research team on knowledge and learning engineering i am responsible for development and running the platform, but more important also do research in the field of massive scalable e-learning. openHPI is based on an SOA with 20+ Microservices, mostly written in Ruby. I also host courses from time to time.
openHPI started in 2013 and is build with the help of a large crowd of students helping us with new features and research.
